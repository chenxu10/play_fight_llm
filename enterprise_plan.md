# Enterprise Trading System TDD Plan (Problem 2)

## Test Implementation Plan (Red → Green → Refactor)

Each test should be implemented one at a time, following strict TDD methodology.

### Phase 1: Basic MarketDataService Structure
- [x] Test 1: Should create empty MarketDataService
- [ ] Test 2: Should initialize with empty subscribers dictionary
- [ ] Test 3: Should have subscribe_user method
- [ ] Test 4: Should have unsubscribe_user method
- [ ] Test 5: Should have broadcast method capability

### Phase 2: User Subscription Management
- [ ] Test 6: Should subscribe single user with connection
- [ ] Test 7: Should track subscriber count
- [ ] Test 8: Should unsubscribe user and remove from subscribers
- [ ] Test 9: Should handle multiple user subscriptions
- [ ] Test 10: Should handle duplicate subscription (replace connection)

### Phase 3: Message Broadcasting - Basic
- [ ] Test 11: Should broadcast message to single subscriber
- [ ] Test 12: Should broadcast message to multiple subscribers
- [ ] Test 13: Should handle broadcast with no subscribers
- [ ] Test 14: Should handle failed connection during broadcast
- [ ] Test 15: Should remove failed connections automatically

### Phase 4: Message Types and Formats
- [ ] Test 16: Should create trade update message format
- [ ] Test 17: Should create order book snapshot message format
- [ ] Test 18: Should create incremental update message format
- [ ] Test 19: Should include sequence numbers in messages
- [ ] Test 20: Should handle message serialization

### Phase 5: Integration with OrderBook
- [ ] Test 21: Should integrate MarketDataService with OrderBook
- [ ] Test 22: Should broadcast trade updates on order execution
- [ ] Test 23: Should broadcast order book updates on new orders
- [ ] Test 24: Should send incremental updates for order changes
- [ ] Test 25: Should send periodic full snapshots

### Phase 6: Real-time Event Publishing
- [ ] Test 26: Should publish trade events immediately
- [ ] Test 27: Should publish order book changes
- [ ] Test 28: Should batch multiple updates efficiently
- [ ] Test 29: Should handle high-frequency trading updates
- [ ] Test 30: Should maintain message ordering

### Phase 7: Connection Management & Scalability
- [ ] Test 31: Should handle connection failures gracefully
- [ ] Test 32: Should support async connection management
- [ ] Test 33: Should handle concurrent user subscriptions
- [ ] Test 34: Should manage memory efficiently with 1000+ connections
- [ ] Test 35: Should implement connection health checks

### Phase 8: Message Sequencing & Consistency
- [ ] Test 36: Should maintain strict message ordering
- [ ] Test 37: Should handle out-of-order message recovery
- [ ] Test 38: Should provide snapshot + incremental sync
- [ ] Test 39: Should detect and handle missed messages
- [ ] Test 40: Should implement message acknowledgment

### Phase 9: Performance & Enterprise Features
- [ ] Test 41: Should handle 1000 concurrent subscribers efficiently
- [ ] Test 42: Should implement message rate limiting
- [ ] Test 43: Should support user-specific subscriptions
- [ ] Test 44: Should implement graceful service shutdown
- [ ] Test 45: Should provide system health metrics

### Phase 10: End-to-End Integration
- [ ] Test 46: Should handle complete trade lifecycle with broadcasting
- [ ] Test 47: Should support multiple concurrent trades
- [ ] Test 48: Should maintain consistency across all subscribers
- [ ] Test 49: Should implement the example scenario (1000 users)
- [ ] Test 50: Should handle edge cases and error recovery

## Architecture Decisions to Test

### Message Format Strategy
- **Incremental Updates**: Test that only changes are sent (95% of messages)
- **Periodic Snapshots**: Test full state every N updates or time interval
- **Sequence Integrity**: Test that messages maintain strict ordering

### Scaling Strategy  
- **Connection Pooling**: Test efficient WebSocket management
- **Memory Optimization**: Test shared message objects
- **Async Broadcasting**: Test non-blocking message distribution

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: < 10ms from trade to user notification
- **Throughput**: Handle 10,000+ messages/second
- **Memory**: Efficient scaling to 1000+ connections
- **CPU**: Minimize per-message processing overhead

## Implementation Notes
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Follow Kent Beck's TDD cycle strictly: Red → Green → Refactor
- Make structural changes (Tidy First) separate from behavioral changes
- Commit frequently with clear commit messages
- Each test should focus on one small behavior increment
- Use mocks for connection objects during testing
- Test both happy path and error conditions
